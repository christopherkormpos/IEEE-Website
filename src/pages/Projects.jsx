                    <h3> Dataset creation for chatbot training </h3>

                    <p>

                        Creation of a dataset for intent classification and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for training a BERT-based model.
                        It will be used for answering student or interested parties questions about the educational and research activities
                        of a research lab and student clubs of a University. The dataset will be used in order to prepare a prototype chatbot
                        for the CONCERT lab and the University of West Attica IEEE Student branch.

                    <h3> Development of a "digital wardrobe" with the ability to suggest clothing </h3>

                    <p>

                        Creation of a digital wardrobe in which we can register metadata (descriptions) or photos of the objects it will contain.
                        Items will be stored in our digital wardrobe with a lot of detail but be distinct enough so that the app can display them
                        with a small range of search options. For the specific project, there is a specific usage scenario like selection of clothing
                        related to events, etc.
